## Style Guidelines

Each notable action that is taken should be printed in a stylized manner, before it occurs. This serves both to update the user on progress and also to make debug messages readily accessible when things go wrong.

Status messages should be colored and bolded.
Paths should be colored and not be bolded.
Removal is always colored in RED.
Yes/No prompts are always GREEN questions and BLUE answer on the line.
Git-related output should be YELLOW.
