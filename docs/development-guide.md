## Development Guide

**Running the code** 

`$ python3 -m shallow_backup`

**Testing the code**

```shell
$ cd tests
$ pipenv run python3 -m pytest
```

Make sure all tests pass before opening a PR!

**Code Style**

All new code should follow the code style established in the code base. PRs with changes in indentation style _will not be merged._

PEP8 is generally to be followed, but I think that prettier code to look at in an editor is more important that strictly following PEP8.
